# DARQ Ultrawide Resolution Editor

## What is DARQ?

DARQ is a indie game made by Unfold Games.  
https://store.steampowered.com/app/433550/DARQ/

## Why this GitHub project?

Sadly, DARQ doesn't support ultrawide resolutions, those are not selectable from the settings.

This tool is able to edit the save file and apply whatever resolution you want.

## Where can I download it?

Download link:  
https://github.com/Nicnl/darq_ultrawide_resolution_editor/releases/download/0.1/darq_resolution_editor.exe

## How can I use it?

Two ways:

1. Launch it directly, and it'll find the save file on it's own.
2. Drag and drop your DARQ save file directly over the program icon. (just like when you move a file inside a folder)
